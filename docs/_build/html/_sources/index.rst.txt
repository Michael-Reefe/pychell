pychell
=======

The tldr; A environment to:

1. Reduce single trace multi-order echelle spectra.
2. Generate radial velocities for stellar sources.

The idea of pychell is to:

1. Separate out the core steps needed to obtain the above.
2. Provide as many of the default routines needed to obtain the above.
3. Provide a simple interace to modify these default methods.

Below is the remaining documentation, tutorials, API, and instructions on adding support for new spectrographs.
