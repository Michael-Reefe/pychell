Installation
************

It is recommended the user installs with pip.

From GitHub
===========

Download with

``git clone https://github.com/astrobc1/pychell``

Change directories into the head pychell directory, and install with

``pip install .``

From PyPI
=========

As of now, pypi limits file sizes to 60 MB, so the code must be downloaded and installed via GitHub. A bypass request has not yet been made.
