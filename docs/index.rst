pychell
=======

The tldr; A environment to:

1. Reduce single trace multi-order echelle spectra via optimal extraction.
2. Generate radial velocities for stellar sources via forward modeling reduced 1-dimensional spectra.

**Idea**: The core idea of pychell is to modularize the core steps of processing echelle spectra for precise radial velocity work, and provide a simple yet powerful interface to interact with.

Below is the remaining documentation, tutorials, API, and instructions on adding support for new spectrographs and data sets.
